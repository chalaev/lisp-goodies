Change log for [[https://github.com/chalaev/lisp-goodies][(e)Lisp Goodies]].

* Numerous changes after long pause in updates.
Significant change in the (emacs-lisp) sections mostly responsible for configuration files treatment.

*** 08/11
These updates are probably final;
for now I do not plan to publish more updates
unless this project turns out to be useful for the lisp community.

1. stopped mentioning (no more existing) =safe-mkdir= in [[file:headers.org][headers.org]]
2. updated =read-conf-file= so now config parameters may have multi-word (separated by spaces) values
3. (common lisp) functions =let-conf= and =letc= (that previously had only elisp-version) became now available in [[file:generated/conf.lisp][conf.lisp]]

*** 08/02
1. added [[file:LICENSE.txt][LICENSE.txt]]
2. improved =eval-on-save= mechanism
3. fixed =case-expand=
4. (CL) added functions =rand-str=, =charToInt=, =intToChar= to [[file:generated/conf.lisp][conf.lisp]]
5. updated [[file:shalaev.asd][shalaev.asd]]

*** 07/03
1. eLisp: added global variable =*safe-chars*= and function =intToChar=
2. common lisp: added macros =case*=, =case-expand=, and =case-f=.
3. common lisp: added *separate package* =:shalaev/conf= with (only one for now) function =read-conf-file= – 
   simplest configuration file reader for integer numbers and words (i.e., lines with no spaces).
4. common lisp: made variable =r= local in =case-f=

*** 04/28 (eLisp)
1. Replaced =update-conf= with =let-conf= and =letc=.
2. Updated =read-conf-file=; now it is more robust towards bad config files.
3. Added global =*config-directory*= variable.
4. Added optional =max-size= argument into =read-line= and =read-conf-file=.
5. Removed =define-vars=.
6. Added optional =home-dir= argument to =untilde=.
7. Added =transpose= block with the example of how code is generated from an org-mode table.
8. Now requiring =cl-lib= instead of [[https://nullprogram.com/blog/2017/10/27/][deprecated]] =cl=.
9. Other (probably minor) updates.

*** 04/30 (eLisp)
1. updated ensure-dir-exists
2. updated read-conf-file
3. updated read-line

*** unspecified date (eLisp)
1. emacs logging system: added milliseconds to time stamps
2. added optional file name argument to =log-flush=

* Lazy Improvements
** slow updates
*** 02/19
renamed =helpers/derive-version.el= → [[file:version.el][version.el]] and [[file:packaged/version.el][packaged it]].

*** 02/10
1. corrected error in [[file:helpers/derive-version.el][derive-version.el]] which sometimes generated wrong version from [[file:change-log.org][change-log.org]]
2. (CL) removed =without-key= and =drop-key=
3. (CL) added =without= and =drop= to the list of exported symbols

*** 02/04 Emacs Lisp
Moved =need-dir= here from [[https://github.com/chalaev/cloud/blob/master/1.el][cloud project]].

*** 02/01 Common Lisp
1. (CL) replaced =id= → =identity=
2. added =without=, =drop=, =without-key=, and =drop-key=
3. in [[file:Makefile][Makefile]]: removed missing (and useless) file =packaging.org=

*** 01/18
**** Emacs Lisp
updated
1. README.org
2. =read-conf-file= to allow non-latin (e.g., Cyrillic) characters in parameter values

**** Common Lisp
added test for ~ifn~

*** 01/11 Emacs Lisp
updated =update-conf=

*** 01/06 Emacs Lisp
Used =letf= to name my new macro, but this name is already taken.
So renamed =letf= → =lett=

*** 01/05 Emacs Lisp
1. replaced (probably useless) =flet= with (new macro) =letf=
2. renamed =packaged/start.el= → [[file:packaged/start.el][packaged/start.el]]

*** 01/04 Emacs Lisp
1. re-wrote =s-find=,
2. added another test for it, and
3. moved =update-conf= from [[https://github.com/chalaev/cloud][cloud project]]

*** 12/31 Common Lisp
exported symbols in =(defpackage :shalaev ...)=

* Packaging eLisp code
** fat removal
(For some macros/functions) switching to conditions (exceptions) instead of returning =(nil . :error-reason)= in case of problems.
*** 12/28
1. Moved several code pieces from [[https://github.com/chalaev/cloud][cloud project]] to [[https://github.com/chalaev/lisp-goodies][lisp-goodies]] because I will use them in my new [[https://github.com/chalaev/el-backup][el-backup project]].
2. Decided that some functions/macros are not really useful and erased them: =mv=, =cp=, =safe-insert-file=, =safe-mkdir=, =cons-to-list=.

** 2020-12-07
Moved some code out of [[file:packaged/shalaev.el][shalaev.el]] adding bew files:
1. [[file:generated/load.el][load.el]] provides =load*= function for loading non-packaged code,
2. [[file:generated/local-packages.el][local-packages.el]] helps to =require= local (unavailable from ELPA) packages like [[file:packaged/shalaev.el][shalaev.el]], and
3. [[file:generated/make.el][make.el]] contains elisp code used in [[file:Makefile][Makefile]]s.

These files are merged into [[file:packaged/start.el][packaged/start.el]] which is loaded by my =~/.emacs= at start:

=(load-file "~/projects/lisp-goodies/packaged/start.el")=

*** 2020-12-14
1. upgraded =make-temp-file= on emacs versions ≤25
2. (ELisp) removed =when-let= and =if-let=
3. added [[file:generated/make.log][make.log]]

*** 2020-12-11
1. added (ELisp) =emacs-ver=
2. added =mv=, =cp=, =when-let*= 
3. updated =when-let=

*** 2020-12-09
It was all about ELisp this time.
1. Added [[file:bash/detect-emacs.sh][detect-emacs.sh]] and simplified [[file:.login][~/.login]] accrodingly.
2. Removed my =if-let= elisp-code because it is already defined in ~subr-x.el~.
3. made =safe-mkdir= recursive (elisp).
4. added =ensure-dir-exists= (elisp).

*** 2020-12-22
minor updates

** 2020-12-04
1. (See [[file:Makefile][Makefile]].) Packaged el-code by putting =generated/*.el=  (except for ~dot.emacs~) into =~/.emacs.d/local-packages/shalaev.el=; later I will probably split it into different files.
2. Updated section "emacs configuration in ~/.emacs" in [[file:shalaev.org][shalaev.org]]

* September-October 2020
Decided to share some of my macros and functions

** 2020-11-28
Started adding tests for elisp code.

*** 2020-12-02
1. Added ~dolist-collect~ replacing CL's =(loop for x in my-list collect ...)=.
2. Renamed ~find~ → ~s-find~ in order to distinguish it from ~find~ defined in ~cl.el~.
   Added tests for ~s-find~.

** 2020-11-18
packaged the Common Lisp part of the code

*** 2020-11-27
added this Change Log

*** 2020-11-24
added (sb-rt) tests

** 2020-11-17
updated "if-let" + "ifn-let" + (CL) "when-let" + "needs-set" + "cond-let"
(Before this update the code was barely useful.)
